"So, pretty easy to see where most of the debris ended up. Nearly all of it is within 1,500 meters of the implosion (lower right). Obviously, there is a lot of water in that small area. Even after a violent implosion, most pieces do not travel far in water. We know that from experience. I'm sure someone has the math for the difference between a deeply submerged implosion and a similar event on Earth's surface. The trajectories would be distinctly different.

"I've had quite a few questions about choosing travel agents as a result of my recent call for help (still going through those DMs, thank you all!) so I'll drop some things I learned, some things I'm looking for going forward. I'm no expert and learned a ton fast (and the hard way) but here goes:

1️⃣ Do a search on the company. Search for lawsuits, court docs, customer complaints, etc. It's an easy red flag to knock out: avoid working with people who've lost lawsuits because of bad business. Hopefully positive reviews outweigh negative ones, but pay attention to any patterns in the negative.

2️⃣ Get proof of any certifications or awards. Most of these certifications are through large, reputable issuers who have search capabilities on their sites. If you can't find the name on the site, and the agency can't show proof, RUN. Same with awards: it's great to hear someone acknowledged for great work, but don't take their word for it, they're trying to make a sale. I'm a big believer in the ""verify"" part of ""trust but verify."" You can even check if many agents are registered for whatever company you plan on using for the actual trip, for example, Royal Caribbean.

3️⃣ Check out their website, marketing, and pay attention to their communications. Expect successful companies to invest in their brand, and look for that investment to reflect in all they do.

4️⃣ Ask for proof of successful events that align with what you're looking for--need a secluded private resort? Get details. Need a group theme cruise and they say they're the best? Get proof! If they can't supply it, you'll find someone who can.

5️⃣ Don't hesitate to do your own research with the destination. Make sure you know what all your options are, and talk about them with the agency. I understand things can change, but if there's any dishonesty, run! There are plenty of qualified agencies out there who will be honest with you, expect the best.

6️⃣ Save EVERYTHING! Emails, texts, photos, etc. Back it up in the event of something happening to email, or your phone. You never know what you'll need later.

7️⃣ Finally, work with someone who shares similar interests. If you want to party, it's easy to find the best travel arrangement with someone who also knows how to have fun 😂"
